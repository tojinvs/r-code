# define statistics and explain why it is important for understanding and evaluateing data ?
# Statistics: Branch of math for collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

# Importance for Understanding and Evaluating Data:
# 1. Summarizes complex data (mean, median) for easier understanding.
# 2. Aids decision-making by measuring certainty (e.g., hypothesis testing).
# 3. Identifies patterns/trends (e.g., correlation, regression analysis).

#  Define and explain why statistics is important for data analytics?
# Importance for Data Analytics:
# 1. Provides methods to clean and preprocess raw data.
# 2. Offers tools for creating models and testing predictions.
# 3. Supports interpreting results, critical for insights and solutions.
